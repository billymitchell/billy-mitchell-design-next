      "Intro Text": "<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Design a bold, underground-inspired visual identity for *Rumble Room*, a DJ event series built around the visceral experience of sound — transforming the idea of a speaker-filled room into a striking visual language.</p>\n\n<h3>Contributions</h3>\n<p>Created two poster designs for *Rumble Room* events, focusing on minimalist, high-impact aesthetics. Conceptualized the room as an abstracted space of overwhelming sound, visually represented through stark black and white graphics. Designed clean, vertical typography treatments with geometric elements such as circles and lines to evoke loudspeaker cones and the pulse of bass-driven music. Incorporated subtle highlight effects and rainbow accents to add dimension and visual pop. Delivered print-ready and digital assets that captured the underground feel and exclusivity of the event concept.</p>\n\n<h3>Outcomes</h3>\n<p>Produced a visually cohesive and memorable poster style for the *Rumble Room* series. Contributed to initial event branding efforts and helped build early audience interest. Strengthened personal exploration of bold, poster-driven design language within the context of music and event culture.</p>",

Built UI for pulling associated product data across multiple tiers (4-star, 5-star, unrestricted) with handling, airing, and lookup systems. Implemented post-checkout database updates to lock redemptions and sync product purchasing logic across store platforms.</p>\n\n<h3>Outcomes</h3>\n<p>Seamless redemption experience tailored to property type and award level. Unified interface for controlled product sales linked to award eligibility. Secure, automated validation and tracking across award and e-commerce systems. Scalable solution supporting multiple store platforms and future cycles.</p>",

Created a visual identity for three back-to-back events with DJ S using a consistent two-tone black and blue aesthetic, disco ball motifs, and playful mirrored layouts featuring each DJ. Incorporated humorous elements, including DJ monkey imagery for two events and Star Wars-inspired Yoda and Darth Vader visuals for a themed Star Wars Day event (substituting the Death Star for the disco ball).</p>\n\n<p>For the July 4th event with Cheeky Willy, shifted the approach to dynamic animated visuals with red, white, and blue swirling effects and simple, clean typography to match the holiday theme. For the event with DJ TE, developed a more futuristic, city-inspired design featuring liquid gold and skyline textures against a minimalist blue background — focusing on visual clarity and marketing effectiveness.</p>\n\n<h3>Outcomes</h3>\n<p>Delivered a flexible, engaging flyer series that enhanced promotion across digital channels for multiple Royal Blue Bar events. Helped build visual consistency and audience recognition for the recurring event series. Strengthened collaborative relationships with Baltimore DJs and the Royal Blue Bar community through creative design and marketing support.</p>",

      "Intro Text": "<h3>Goals</h3>\n<p>Design cohesive and engaging visual assets for a series of DJ events at Royal Blue Bar in Baltimore, with varied flyer concepts tailored to each event’s unique vibe while building a recognizable visual presence for the series.</p>\n\n<h3>Contributions</h3>\n<p>Designed promotional visuals for five separate Royal Blue Bar DJ events, collaborating with DJs DJ S, Cheeky Willy, and Tarek Evolve (DJ TE). Created a visual identity for three back-to-back events with DJ S using a consistent two-tone black and blue aesthetic, disco ball motifs, and playful mirrored layouts featuring each DJ. Incorporated humorous elements, including DJ monkey imagery for two events and Star Wars-inspired Yoda and Darth Vader visuals for a themed Star Wars Day event (substituting the Death Star for the disco ball).</p>\n\n<p>For the July 4th event with Cheeky Willy, shifted the approach to dynamic animated visuals with red, white, and blue swirling effects and simple, clean typography to match the holiday theme. For the event with DJ TE, developed a more futuristic, city-inspired design featuring liquid gold and skyline textures against a minimalist blue background — focusing on visual clarity and marketing effectiveness.</p>\n\n<h3>Outcomes</h3>\n<p>Delivered a flexible, engaging flyer series that enhanced promotion across digital channels for multiple Royal Blue Bar events. Helped build visual consistency and audience recognition for the recurring event series. Strengthened collaborative relationships with Baltimore DJs and the Royal Blue Bar community through creative design and marketing support.</p>",
